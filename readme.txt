WIS Scrapper provides easier Wordpress backups! Clone & backup an intact site including its database. 

== Description ==
WIS Scrapper successfully gives WordPress users the ability to download the whole website with a database which helps in migrate, copy, or clone a site from one location to another and also serves as a simple backup utility. Standard WordPress backups are easily handled by this plugin.

== Overview ==
WIS Scrapper enables you to:
1.	Pull down a live site to localhost for development
2.	Easy reiterate by bundling up an entire WordPress site Content.
3.	Manual backups when needed.

== Installation Instructions ==
1.	Upload `WIS Scrapper` zip file to Plugins -> Add New -> Upload Plugin.
2.	Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

== How it Works ==
1.	After activating plugin, new Menu named “WIS Scrapper will be added in Admin Dashboard.
2.	When clicking this menu, page to create new Backup Url will be opened. 
3.  On clicking “Create New Backup URL” button, the build will start.
4.  After new Backup Url is made successfully, the user will be notified as “Backup URL created Successfully ”.
5.  When Backup URL is made, a download link is provided.
6.  When clicked on that download link, a zip file is downloaded with SQL file and content.

== Migrate WordPress and Run WordPress Backups ==
WIS Scrapper creates a Backup that bundles all the site's plugins, themes, content, database, and WordPress files into a simple zip file called a Wis_Scrapper_Backup with hash keys, date and time on which it is created. This Backup contains two folders in it. One Containing the SQL file and another folder having the site content. This Backup can then be used to easily migrate a WordPress site to any location you wish. *WordPress is not required for installation* since the Backup contains all site files.

== Improve Your Workflow with Pre-Bundled Sites ==
WIS Scrapper gives you a chance to make your very own preconfigured sites to eliminate rework.  Rather than reconfiguring your most loved theme, plugins or content persistently, now just back up a single site and bundle it up into a WIS Scrapper Backup. Once you have the bundled site, you can migrate the WordPress site over and over to different locations to instantly create many preconfigured sites!
